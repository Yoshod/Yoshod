# About Me
* I'm a 22 year old guy who occasionally likes to make things with Python. I don't work as a programmer and I'm self taught outside a small amount of high school lessons.
* My character is SÃ¨itheach, a wolf furry.
* I exclusively make things in Python but want to learn some Rust at some point.
* My main project is Sersi! A custom discord bot that does almost everything and then some.
* To contact me I can be reached at [telegram](http://t.me/wolfseitheach), [email](mailto:seitheach@sersi.io), or on discord at @hekkland
